# DockedEmu

A simple script for Steam Deck emulation, designed to increase an emulators native resolution when on the official Steam Deck Dock.

Very W.I.P.

## Installation 
todo

## Usage
Whether creating a new non-Steam game or editing one made my Steam Rom Manager, go to it's page and edit the properities.

Change 'Target' to `"./run.sh"`

Change 'Start in' to the path where the script is stored

In launch options, at the very beginning, add the emulator preset you want to use, for example, "dolphin", then add in any other parameters for the emulator, such as the path to the game
